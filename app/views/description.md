###Proposal for the Creation of Subsets of Theoretical Practice (STPs)

The following is a brief outline of the various operations belonging to the Subset of Theoretical Practice (STP). It must be noted that there is already a working group of STP, whose primary language is English, though most members of the group are able to speak other languages.

It is advised that future groups also contain at least one member who speaks English, or has access to a translator internal or external to CSII, in order to facilitate exchange of research material. Further protocols for forming new groups are documented below.


####General description

The purpose of STP is to produce theoretical material about the Circle, defined as texts, presentations, visual aids, etc. which allow us to grasp impasses in the formation and continual operation of the various Circle cells. STP must therefore be directly linked to the discussions of impasses arising from the Global and Regional Unified Meetings. The extent to which a formal treatment of concrete problems of organization is actually helpful to those organizing is an ongoing question for all members of STP. However, there is also the obverse question, equally as important, regarding the global character of local impasses themselves. This second problem is what allows us to regard the Circle not as a decentralized collection of groups, but one bound by a common form.
Cyclical Structure
STP’s mode of operating is cyclical, though its frequency may vary in different cases. The cycle can be described as having 6 phases:

1. Discussion
2. Definition
3. Work
4. Research
5. Decision
6. Production

####Discussion

The purpose of the discussion is to identify any new questions that might arise from the current impasses of the Circle. This can be one or more meetings in which members reflect on the previous cycle of Global or Regional meetings. It is permitted that members outside of STP can be invited to these meetings so that they can contribute to the detailed account of a given impasse. The nature of these meetings is necessarily informal, though there might already be a partially formal treatment of the problem (due to the work of previous cycles).

####Definition

Out of the initial discussions, two documents should be written and made available online:

1. Research directives. Each participant of an STP must produce a short text of about one page in which it is described: (a) which problems of CSII one has decided to focus on; (b) which line of research will be oriented by these problems; (c ) an initial bibliography. Each participant must create their own research project, even if it might have relation with the projects of other members of the Circle or with the participant’s own academic interests outside of the Circle - the only condition is that the research directive should make clear what is the relation between the study orientation it proposes and the local problems of CSII. The compilation of research directives proposed by the participants of the subset will then be made available for all the members of the Circle, for voluntary evaluation. For a week, all the participants of the Circle will be invited to verify if there truly is a relation between the impasses of CSII and the research directives that have been proposed. If a proposal is not approved, the participant who wrote it will have a chance to either clarify it or to come up with a new idea. It is also allowed that at the end of each work cycle (see point 3), the research directive of a given project be made more precise or even changed.

2. Schedule. Besides the compilation of individual research directives, the subset must also produce a schedule containing its internal rules of functioning - that is, (a) the frequency and date/time of its meetings and (b) the cycle of presentations it proposes for itself. The rules of each subset are of creation of the subset itself - the remaining participants of the Circle are responsible for helping out solely with the keeping of the rules that have been created.

####Work

The work phase is the longest part of each cycle, and is comprised of  presentation and debate meetings. While the previous two phases are undertaken as a group, the work phase is divided into several sub-cycles in which a single member of STP is given the prerogative to organize a given meeting to suit his research and mode of elaboration. A sub-cycle is thus a set of presentation and debate meetings in which one member is the principal organizer. Though the principal organizer has a degree of flexibility regarding the meeting structure - it is required that these meetings  privilege investigation over production. In other words, the researcher should pose questions which are accessible for the audience, and allot time in which the audience themselves can ask questions, etc. and not simply lecture to the others.

We also suggest that, if by the end of a discussion a participant of the STP has not spoken, a 10 minute “voluntary obligatory commentary” of the topic be offered to him.

####Research Updates

After each work sub-cycle is complete, the individual researcher must provide an update to the public, both Circle members and non-members. The most convenient way for doing this is to post the update online on the STP website. This update should be a short summary of what was presented during the work meetings, as well as any pertinent criticisms or open questions raised in the debate meetings. The researcher must also describe any changes that were made to her line of research as a result of the now completed sub-cycle. All research updates must be translated to the other primary languages of the Circle.

####Decision

In parallel to the research updates, the group may decide that a given line of research has reached a certain threshold of maturity, such that it is ready for a more formal treatment. This moment of crystallization must be voiced by 1 member of STP which is not the researcher herself. After that, other members of the group may decide to agree or disagree with the assessment, giving reasons if they disagree. If all members agree, the individual researcher is now given the task to write a formal text on the subject of the research - the destiny of which will also be decided in the next phase.

####Production

Besides the presentation materials of the work phase, there can be written texts which crystallize the results of the research. These formal texts are the only materials created by STP which are allowed to be published outside of the Circle, potentially under the name of the researcher. It is also allowed that multiple members of the group may be enlisted to help write this formal text. It is not required that these texts be translated to the other languages within the Circle, though this is highly encouraged. Finally, any production for external circulation must contain a reference to the Circle and STP, while products for internal circulation must contain the numerical of each author.
